<h3 class="text-primary text-center">jQuery Playground</h3>

<!--
Now let's build something from scratch to practice our HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills.

We'll build a jQuery playground, which we'll soon put to use in our jQuery challenges.

To start with, create an h3 element, with the text jQuery Playground.

Color your h3 element with the text-primary Bootstrap class, and center it with the text-center Bootstrap class.

1. Add a h3 element to your page.
2. Make sure your h3 element has a closing tag.
3. Your h3 element should be colored by applying the class text-primary
4. Your h3 element should be centered by applying the class text-center
5. Your h3 element should have the text jQuery Playground.
