<!--
Bootstrap has a class called well that can create a visual sense of depth for your columns.

Nest one div element with the class well within each of your col-xs-6 div elements.

1. Add a div element with the class well inside each of your div elements with the class "col-xs-6"
2. Nest both of your div elements with the class "col-xs-6" within your div element with the class "row".
3. Make sure all your div elements have closing tags.
